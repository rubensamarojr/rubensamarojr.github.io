I am a Postdoctoral fellow in [Civil Construction Engineering](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en) at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/#english), Brazil.

Before this:

* I was Postdoctoral fellow (2022-2024) in the [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (ICMC-USP)](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en)
* I was Postdoctoral fellow (2021) in the [Civil Construction Engineering at USP](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en)
* I earned my Ph.D. (2020) and Master's degree (2013) in [Civil Construction Engineering at USP](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en)
* I graduated (2009) in [Mechanical Engineering - Automation and Systems at USP](http://www.pmr.poli.usp.br)

My experience is in the Mechanical Engineering with emphasis on dynamics of fluids and elastic/rigid bodies, working mainly on the following topics: 

* Computer simulation
* Meshless particle-based methods (MPS, SPH)
* Fluid-structure interaction

I am developer of the open-source code [PolyMPS](https://github.com/rubensamarojr/polymps), a Lagrangian particle-based framework to simulate free-surface flows using the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method.
