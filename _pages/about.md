I am a Postdoctoral Research at the [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en) from the [University of S達o Paulo (ICMC-USP)](http://www.saocarlos.usp.br/welcome-to-usp-sao-carlos), S達o Carlos, Brazil. 


TEST


I earned my Ph.D. (2020) and Master's degree (2013) in [Civil Engineering from the University of S達o Paulo](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en) and graduated (2009) in [Mechanical Engineering - Automation and Systems from the University of S達o Paulo](http://www.pmr.poli.usp.br). My experience is in the Mechanical Engineering with emphasis on dynamics of fluids and elastic/rigid bodies, working mainly on the following topics: 

* Computer simulation
* Meshless particle-based methods (MPS, SPH)
* Fluid-structure interaction
* Hydroelasticity

I am a developer of the [PolyMPS](https://github.com/rubensamarojr/polymps), a mesh-free Lagrangian particle-based code to simulate free-surface flow using the Moving Particle Simulation/Semi-implicit (MPS) method.
