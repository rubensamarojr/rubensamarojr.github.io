I am a Postdoctoral Research (2022-2024) at the  <a href="/https://www.icmc.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences</a> from the [University of São Paulo (ICMC-USP)](http://www.saocarlos.usp.br/welcome-to-usp-sao-carlos), São Carlos, Brazil. 

Before this:

* I was Postdoctoral Research (2021) at the <a href="/http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Civil Engineering from the USP</a> [](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en)
* I earned my Ph.D. (2020) and Master's degree (2013) in <a href="/http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Civil Engineering from the USP</a> [](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en)
* I graduated (2009) in <a href="/http://www.pmr.poli.usp.br" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering - Automation and Systems from the USP</a>

My experience is in the Mechanical Engineering with emphasis on dynamics of fluids and elastic/rigid bodies, working mainly on the following topics: 

* Computer simulation
* Meshless particle-based methods (MPS, SPH)
* Fluid-structure interaction
* Hydroelasticity

I am developer of the open-source code <a href="/https://github.com/rubensamarojr/polymps" target="_blank">PolyMPS</a>, a Lagrangian particle-based framework to simulate free-surface flows using the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method.
