I am a Postdoctoral fellow in <a href="http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Civil Construction Engineering</a> []() at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/#english" target="_blank">University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)</a>, Brazil. The objectives of my work are the improvement and application of the mesh-free Lagrangian particle methods (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_particle_semi-implicit_method" target="_blank">MPS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics" target="_blank">SPH</a>) to tackle the dynamics of multi-physics problems with free-surface flows. My main work covers the following topics:

* Computer simulation
* Meshless particle-based methods (MPS, SPH)
* Fluid-structure interaction
* Free-surface flow

I am developer of the open-source code <a href="https://github.com/rubensamarojr/polymps" target="_blank">PolyMPS</a>, a Lagrangian particle-based framework to simulate free-surface flows using the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method.

Before my current work at USP:

* I was Postdoctoral fellow (2022-2024) in the <a href="https://www.icmc.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (ICMC-USP)</a>
* I was Postdoctoral fellow (2021) in the <a href="http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Civil Construction Engineering at USP</a>
* I earned my Ph.D. (2020) and Master's degree (2013) in <a href="http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en" target="_blank">Civil Construction Engineering at USP</a>
* I graduated (2009) in <a href="http://www.pmr.poli.usp.br" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering - Automation and Systems at USP</a>
