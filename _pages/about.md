I am a Postdoctoral Research in the [Numerical Offshore Tank Laboratory of the University of São Paulo - TPN-USP](http://tpn.usp.br/simulador/Start.html).

I earned my Ph.D. (2020) and Master's degree (2013) in [Civil Engineering from the University of São Paulo](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en/) and graduated (2009) in [Mechanical Engineering - Automation and Systems from the University of São Paulo](http://www.pmr.poli.usp.br/). My experience is in the Mechanical Engineering with emphasis on dynamics of fluids and elastic/rigid bodies, working mainly on the following topics: computer simulation, meshless particle-based method, moving particle semi-implicit (MPS), fluid-structure interaction and hydroelasticity.
