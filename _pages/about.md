I am a Postdoctoral Research at the [Civil Engineering from the USP](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en) from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/#english), São Paulo, Brazil. 

Before this:

* I was Postdoctoral Research (2022-2024) at the [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (ICMC)](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en)
* I was Postdoctoral Research (2021) at the [Civil Engineering from the USP](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en)
* I earned my Ph.D. (2020) and Master's degree (2013) in [Civil Engineering from the USP](http://ppgec.poli.usp.br/en)
* I graduated (2009) in [Mechanical Engineering - Automation and Systems from the USP](http://www.pmr.poli.usp.br)

My experience is in the Mechanical Engineering with emphasis on dynamics of fluids and elastic/rigid bodies, working mainly on the following topics: 

* Computer simulation
* Meshless particle-based methods (MPS, SPH)
* Fluid-structure interaction

I am developer of the open-source code [PolyMPS](https://github.com/rubensamarojr/polymps), a Lagrangian particle-based framework to simulate free-surface flows using the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method.
