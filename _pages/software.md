# PolyMPS
[PolyMPS](https://github.com/rubensamarojr/polymps) is a mesh-free Lagrangian particle-based code (C++ language) that I've written to simulate free-surface flow using the Moving Particle Simulation/Semi-implicit (MPS) method. Explicit, Weakly Compressible or Incompressible versions are available. Boundary walls can be modeled by polygonal mesh (triangles) or particles (walls and dummies).
