My research intetests are related to the development of computational models and their application to environmental fluid mechanics problems. My main focus has been on the study of the mesh-free Lagrangian particle-based methods, e.g., moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). My current areas of particular interests are:

* Particle-based methods (MPS, SPH)
* Coupled solution strategies (particle-mesh coupling)
* Computational fluid dynamics
* Experimental fluid dynamics
* Fluid-structure interaction
* Sloshing
* Green water
* Ice-wave interaction
* Coastal engineering
* Water Supply and Drainage for Buildings
